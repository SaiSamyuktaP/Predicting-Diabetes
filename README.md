# Predicting-Diabetes
A classification problem in Machine Learning
I have solved this problem using Neural Networks. I got an accuracy of approximately 90%, and the total time taken to compute it will be about 30 secs

## Libraries Used:
1. Keras
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. sklearn
5. Seaborn

## Define the Model
I defined a model of 3 layers:
1. It has 32 units and the activation function is relu
2. Consisting of 16 units and the same activation function
3. The final layer has one unit, with sigmoid as the activation function

I chose Binary_Crossentropy as the loss function as its a binary problem, Adam as the optimizer function to avoid overfitting and my metric function is accuracy.

## Outputs:
To check the outputs please go through my kaggle link, which I am sharing here also: https://www.kaggle.com/saisamyukta/predicting-diabetes

Thank you!!
